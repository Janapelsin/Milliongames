#### Phaser 3 + ES6 + Webpack

## 1. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/

## 2. Install dependencies

Navigate to the cloned repoâ€™s directory.

Run: ```npm install```

## 3. Run the development server:

Run: ```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser.


## Build for deployment:

Run: ```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
